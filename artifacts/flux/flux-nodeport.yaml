# This defines a Kubernetes service for the Flux daemon, so you can
# access it with `fluxctl`. It defines a NodePort, meaning Kubernetes
# will assign a port to the service, on which it will be available on
# each node (host in the cluster). You can find the assigned port by
# doing something like
#
#    kubectl get service flux --template '{{ index .spec.ports 0 "nodePort" }}'
